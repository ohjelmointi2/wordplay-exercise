# Wordplay lesson exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with various data structures and algorithms, particularly from the perspective of their performance. We will also touch on program performance testing and the concept of ["asymptotic computational complexity"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_computational_complexity).

In the first part of the exercise, we will explore the performance of Java lists. In the latter part, the application to be developed will utilize open name and dictionary data and search for Finnish first names that also have another meaning in the dictionary. Examples of such names are *Tuuli* (wind) and *Onni* (happiness).

üí° *This exercise is not to be submitted or graded separately, so there is no GitHub classroom link for it. You can create your own copy of the task using either the "use this template" or "fork" functions.*

## Data used in the exercise

The Java programs in this exercise utilize several files that are in slightly different formats: the dictionary content is in plain text, while the name data is in CSV format.

The file [`kaikkisanat.txt`](./data/kaikkisanat.txt)  in the exercise package contains Finnish words in plain text in alphabetical order. The files [`etunimitilasto-naiset-ensimmainen.csv`](./data/etunimitilasto-naiset-ensimmainen.csv) and [`etunimitilasto-miehet-ensimmainen.csv`](./data/etunimitilasto-miehet-ensimmainen.csv) contain first names and their counts in [CSV format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).

Information about file copyrights and terms of use can be found further down this page under "Copyrights".

üí° *All files for this exercise are saved with [`UTF-8` character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8). `UTF-8` is [the most common character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popularity_of_text_encodings), but especially in a Windows environment, your system might use a different encoding. You can find more information about character encodings in [this article](https://www.baeldung.com/java-char-encoding).*

## Part 1: performance testing of `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`

In the package [`wordplay.benchmark`](./src/main/java/wordplay/benchmark/) of this repository, you can find the classes [`ArrayListBenchmark`](./src/main/java/wordplay/benchmark/ArrayListBenchmark.java) and [`LinkedListBenchmark`](./src/main/java/wordplay/benchmark/LinkedListBenchmark.java), which contain performance tests. The performance tests illustrate significant differences between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` in terms of data retrieval, traversal, and insertion.

The performance tests are implemented using the [Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH)](https://github.com/openjdk/jmh) tool:

> *"JMH is a Java harness for building, running, and analysing nano/micro/milli/macro benchmarks written in Java and other languages targeting the JVM."*
>
> https://github.com/openjdk/jmh

Run the performance tests by executing the [`BenchmarkRunner`](./src/main/java/wordplay/benchmark/BenchmarkRunner.java) class either with your code editor or using Gradle:

```sh
./gradlew run      # unix
.\gradlew.bat run  # windows
```

üí° *If special characters in the output, such as &thickapprox; and <sup>-4</sup>, do not display correctly on Windows, you can try [changing the terminal's encoding](https://www.google.com/search?q=chcp+65001) to UTF-8 with the command `chcp 65001`.*

`BenchmarkRunner` executes a series of performance tests and prints information about the progress of the tests. The performance tests consist of both a warm-up phase and repeated calls to the methods being tested. The warm-up phase is important to ensure that all necessary components are loaded and the required resources are allocated from the hardware before the actual measurement. The results of the tests, i.e., the average execution time of the different methods, can be found at the end of the report once it is completed:

```
Benchmark                                              Mode  Cnt   Score    Error  Units
ArrayListBenchmark.accessArrayListWithIndex            avgt    5  ‚âà 10‚Åª‚Å¥            s/op
LinkedListBenchmark.accessLinkedListWithIndex          avgt    5   2.792 ¬±  0.118   s/op

ArrayListBenchmark.accessArrayListWithIterator         avgt    5  ‚âà 10‚Åª‚Å¥            s/op
LinkedListBenchmark.accessLinkedListWithIterator       avgt    5  ‚âà 10‚Åª‚Å¥            s/op

ArrayListBenchmark.addStringsToBeginningOfArrayList    avgt    5   0.426 ¬±  0.052   s/op
LinkedListBenchmark.addStringsToBeginningOfLinkedList  avgt    5   0.001 ¬±  0.001   s/op
```

Above, *"avgt"* means *"average time"*. *"Cnt"* refers to the number of executions, and *"score"* indicates the average duration of a single execution of the tested method. *"s/op"* is the unit, meaning seconds per method execution. A more detailed explanation of the executed methods can be found in the following paragraphs.

### Searching the list by index (*accessArrayListWithIndex* and *accessLinkedListWithIndex*)

In the classes [`ArrayListBenchmark`](./src/main/java/wordplay/benchmark/ArrayListBenchmark.java) and [`LinkedListBenchmark`](./src/main/java/wordplay/benchmark/LinkedListBenchmark.java), the same operations are tested with both `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` types of lists. In the initial methods, a Finnish word list is traversed from start to finish, and for each word, its `length()` method is called.

The performance tests are *annotated* with the `@Benchmark` annotation, which allows the JMH tool to recognize them as performance tests:

```java
ArrayList<String> arrayList = new ArrayList<>(finnishWords); // 93 086 words

@Benchmark
public void accessArrayListWithIndex() {
    for (int i = 0; i < arrayList.size(); i++) {
        arrayList.get(i).length();
    }

    // average execution time of the method is 0,0001 seconds
}
```

The above code [utilizing an `ArrayList` type list](./src/main/java/wordplay/benchmark/ArrayListBenchmark.java) is almost identical to the [below `LinkedList` version](./src/main/java/wordplay/benchmark/LinkedListBenchmark.java):

```java
LinkedList<String> linkedList = new LinkedList<>(finnishWords); // 93 086 words

@Benchmark
public void accessLinkedListWithIndex() {
    for (int i = 0; i < linkedList.size(); i++) {
        linkedList.get(i).length();
    }

    // average execution time of the method is 2.792 seconds
}
```

As observed from the test results, the code that iterates through a dataset of [approximately 93,086 words](./data/kaikkisanat.txt) one by one using indices takes an average of 10<sup>-4</sup> or **0.0001 seconds** with an `ArrayList`. The same iteration with a `LinkedList` takes an average of **2.792 seconds**, which is **about 30,000 times longer**:

```
Benchmark                                           Mode  Cnt   Score    Error  Units
ArrayListBenchmark.accessArrayListWithIndex         avgt    5  ‚âà 10‚Åª‚Å¥            s/op
LinkedListBenchmark.accessLinkedListWithIndex       avgt    5   2.792 ¬±  0.118   s/op
```

In an `ArrayList` type list, searching for a specific value by index requires only one lookup operation, [because it internally uses an array](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/6aa197667ad05bd93adf3afc7b06adbfb2b18a22/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/ArrayList.java#L133-L139). Therefore, iterating through all the values in the list requires only as many operations as the length of the list:

```java
// repeated as many times as the length of the list (n times):
for (int i = 0; i < arrayList.size(); i++) {

    // search in an array only requires 1 operation
    arrayList.get(i);
}

// in total, n * 1 operations are performed: O(n)
```

In `LinkedList` type lists, elements are "in sequence" and searching for a single value from the middle [requires traversing all preceding values either from the start or the end to the desired index](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/6aa197667ad05bd93adf3afc7b06adbfb2b18a22/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/LinkedList.java#L574-L591). For example, searching from index 10 in a linked list requires first traversing through "links/nodes" 0, 1, 2, ... 9, assuming the traversal starts from the beginning of the list.

Since Java's linked list can be traversed either [from start to end or from end to start](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/LinkedList.html), the average distance of each index from the starting point is 1/4 of the list's length. Therefore, a search operation on our list of approximately 90,000 words requires traversing an average of about 22,500 "links/nodes".

```java
// operations equivalent to the length of the list (n):
for (int i = 0; i < linkedList.size(); i++) {

    // each `get` call requires an average of n/4 operations:
    linkedList.get(i);
}

// in total, approximately n * n/4 operations are performed: O(n¬≤)
```

When evaluating performance tests and efficiency, measurement accuracy is not perfect, nor does it need to be. What is more important is understanding how the algorithm performs relative to the size of the dataset it processes. An algorithm whose operations scale with the dataset size as `n * n/4` scales as poorly as an algorithm with a ratio of `n * n` or <code>n<sup>2</sup></code>.

The durations and counts of operations are not as straightforward as presented above, but based on theory and performance tests, it strongly appears that the `LinkedList` performed **tens of thousands of times** slower than the `ArrayList` in this test with the Finnish word list dataset.

üí° *It is also important to note that as the dataset size increases, the performance difference also grows. If the list had ten times the number of elements, traversing the `ArrayList` would take ten times longer. Traversing the `LinkedList`, on the other hand, would take approximately a hundred times longer, because there would be ten times more indices to traverse. Additionally, each `get(i)` call for each index would also be, on average, ten times slower than it is currently.*

### Iterating a list (*accessArrayListWithIterator* and *accessLinkedListWithIterator*)

In the same performance test classes [`ArrayListBenchmark`](./src/main/java/wordplay/benchmark/ArrayListBenchmark.java) and [`LinkedListBenchmark`](./src/main/java/wordplay/benchmark/LinkedListBenchmark.java), there are also other test methods where the values of both `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` type lists are iterated through one by one using *iteration*:

```java
ArrayList<String> arrayList = new ArrayList<>(finnishWords);

@Benchmark
public void accessArrayListWithIterator() {
    for (String word : arrayList) {
        word.length();
    }

    //average execution time of the method is 0,0001 seconds
}
```

```java
LinkedList<String> linkedList = new LinkedList<>(finnishWords);

@Benchmark
public void accessLinkedListWithIterator() {
    for (String word : linkedList) {
        word.length();
    }

    //average execution time of the method is 0,0001 seconds
}
```

In this case, no differences in performance are observed between the lists based on the performance tests. The execution time for both methods is approximately 10<sup>-4</sup> or 0.0001 seconds:

```
Benchmark                                           Mode  Cnt   Score    Error  Units
ArrayListBenchmark.accessArrayListWithIterator      avgt    5  ‚âà 10‚Åª‚Å¥            s/op
LinkedListBenchmark.accessLinkedListWithIterator    avgt    5  ‚âà 10‚Åª‚Å¥            s/op
```

In this iteration-based solution, the same `LinkedList` performs the same task approximately 30,000 times better than in the previous index-based `get(i)` solution.

The improved performance is due to the fact that fetching the next value from a linked list requires only one operation. Although the same values were traversed in both the index-based and iteration-based solutions, using the `get(i)` method required a significant amount of extra work.

Therefore, the performance of both `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` is computationally the same when iterating through the list:

```java
// n words, each requiring only one operation:
for (String word : list) {
    word.length();
}

// Performance is O(n)
```

### Considerations

Although `ArrayList` appears to be superior to `LinkedList` based on the information presented above, the situation is not so straightforward.

`ArrayList` performs poorly in situations where values are added to the beginning or middle of the list. In such cases, the values following the target index need to be [copied forward in the underlying array](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/6aa197667ad05bd93adf3afc7b06adbfb2b18a22/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/ArrayList.java#L501-L522), which can mean copying the entire array's contents one step forward in the worst case. Similarly, when the underlying array of an `ArrayList` becomes full, it needs to be replaced with a new, larger array, which is also a performance-intensive operation. In `LinkedList` type lists, existing values do not need to be moved.

Explore the implementations and performance of the [`addStringsToBeginningOfArrayList`](./src/main/java/wordplay/benchmark/ArrayListBenchmark.java) and [`addStringsToBeginningOfLinkedList`](./src/main/java/wordplay/benchmark/LinkedListBenchmark.java) methods independently.

```
Benchmark                                              Mode  Cnt   Score    Error  Units
ArrayListBenchmark.addStringsToBeginningOfArrayList    avgt    5   0.426 ¬±  0.052   s/op
LinkedListBenchmark.addStringsToBeginningOfLinkedList  avgt    5   0.001 ¬±  0.001   s/op
```

üöÄ *You can also write additional performance tests if you wish, experimenting with different cases where various types of collections perform differently.*

## Part 2: Coding Task

In this Git repository, there is a file [kaikkisanat.txt](./data/kaikkisanat.txt), which contains the [Modern Finnish word list from the Institute for the Languages of Finland](https://kaino.kotus.fi/sanat/nykysuomi/):

```
aakkonen
aakkosellinen
aakkosellisesti
aakkosellisuus
...
```

The repository also contains the files [etunimitilasto-naiset-ensimmainen.csv](./data/etunimitilasto-naiset-ensimmainen.csv) and [etunimitilasto-miehet-ensimmainen.csv](./data/etunimitilasto-miehet-ensimmainen.csv), which include the first names and their corresponding counts found in the name data from the [Digital and Population Data Services Agency](https://www.avoindata.fi/data/fi/organization/digi_ja_vaestotietovirasto):

```
Etunimi;Lukum√§√§r√§
Anne;30 204
Tuula;30 113
P√§ivi;29 789
Anna;28 677
Leena;27 745
...
```

To read these files, there are ready-made methods [`NamesReader.readFirstNames()`](./src/main/java/wordplay/io/NamesReader.java) and [`DictionaryReader.readFinnishWords()`](./src/main/java/wordplay/io/DictionaryReader.java), which return the contents of the files as lists.

### Program structure

Since there are two different types of files, the project has implemented two separate classes for reading them: [DictionaryReader](./src/main/java/wordplay/io/DictionaryReader.java) and [NamesReader](./src/main/java/wordplay/io/NamesReader.java). Both classes implement the [WordplayReader](./src/main/java/wordplay/io/WordplayReader.java) interface, which defines the `readFile` method:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    direction LR

    class NamesInDictionary {
        +main(String[] args)
    }

    class DictionaryReader {
        +readFile(Path file)
        +readFinnishWords()
    }

    class NamesReader {
        +readFile(Path file)
        +readFirstNames()
    }

    class WordplayReader {
        +readFile(Path file)
    }

    NamesInDictionary --> DictionaryReader : uses
    NamesInDictionary --> NamesReader : uses
    DictionaryReader --> WordplayReader: implements
    NamesReader --> WordplayReader : implements
```

In addition to the common `readFile` method, the `NamesReader` and `DictionaryReader` classes have their own helper methods specifically for reading the files they handle:

```java
List<String> finnishNames = NamesReader.readFirstNames();
List<String> finnishWords = DictionaryReader.readFinnishWords();
```

You do not need to implement file handling yourself; you can utilize the aforementioned methods.

### `NamesInDictionary` class

In this task, you need to complete the `main` method in the [`NamesInDictionary`](./src/main/java/wordplay/NamesInDictionary.java) class to iterate through both datasets introduced earlier and **print out Finnish names that are also found in the dictionary**. You should not print names that are only part of a longer word. For example, the name *Antti* appears in words like "elef*antti*" and "deodor*antti*", but not on its own.

You can implement your solution using a loop structure and the list's `contains()` method. Alternatively, the task can also be solved with two nested loops and the `equalsIgnoreCase` method. Regardless of the approach you choose, the solution will likely be quite slow, as for each name (`n=15,665`), you need to go through all the words in the word list (`m=93,086`). This solution would require `n * m` operations, which means a total of 1,458,192,190 comparison operations with these datasets.

Even if your computer is powerful, a ["brute force"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search) solution that iterates through the lists and compares all words will likely take several seconds.

Using the `HashMap` data structure covered in the course as part of this solution might be beneficial. You can also explore the [`HashSet`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashSet.html) data structure, which operates similarly to `HashMap`, but stores only individual values instead of key-value pairs. The list's `contains()` method requires traversing the entire list, whereas `HashMap`'s `containsKey` requires only one operation ([baeldung.com](https://www.baeldung.com/java-treemap-vs-hashmap)).

‚è± *If your program produces the correct solution in tenths of a second, it is likely efficiently implemented.*

üí° *Note that the case of letters in names and dictionary words is not the same. For example, in the name file, `"Tuuli"` is written with an uppercase initial letter, while in the dictionary it is written in lowercase `"tuuli"`.*

### Correct solution

Information about the number of names found in the word list can be found in the accompanying file [ratkaisu.en.md](./ratkaisu.en.md).
